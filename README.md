Don't forget to add the datasets in the . path from this https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/visa. We focused on the Candle package, and our model is vertically scalable, allowing it to be trained with other packages.

You should first train your model by launching the train.py file in the src directory. This process will also calculate the carbon impact using the CodeCarbon library.

After training, run the app.py file to perform a test.
